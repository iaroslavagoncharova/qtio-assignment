# Qt Frontend Coding Exercise

Your goal in this exercise is to implement autocomplete functionality using React.

## Running the starter code

You can start the provided Webpack development server by running:

```
docker-compose up app
```

The development server is then accessible via http://localhost:8050.

## Requirements

Requirements are described in the module's test files. Initial requirements can be found in `autocomplete-input.spec.jsx`. Further requirements will be given in respective spec files along with the tests.

## Testing

You can test the implemented solution by running:

```
docker-compose up test
```

The test container will run in watch mode, re-running the test set automatically when the code is updated. A fully valid solution should pass all the test cases.
